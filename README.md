# NaiveToxPred
A collection of programs and data sets created throughout my bachelor thesis.

The repository contains a mix of .fa, .txt, .py and .sh files. 
The .py and .sh files are programs. Whereas the .fa files contains protein sequences downloaded from Uniprot and subsequently 
modified by SortingDuplicates.py. These .fa files are used as input for both PerformanceLoop.sh and NaiveToxPred.v1.0.py. 
The .txt files are created by PerformanceLoop.sh and NaiveToxPred.v1.0.py, thus output files from the two programs.

The numbered files corresponds to three case studies, each case running two tests creating different output.
